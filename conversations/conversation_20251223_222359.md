I am taking MATH410 next semester. Whats the rigor like, and what professor is the best for an A

---

## Assistant

MATH410, "Advanced Calculus I," has an average GPA of **2.45**, indicating it's a challenging course. Student discussions on Reddit confirm its rigor, often describing it as a "dreaded" or "crazy proofs class." Many students express concern about taking it alongside other demanding courses.

Based on student sentiment regarding professors for MATH410 and similar courses:

*   **Justin Wyss-Gallifent** receives positive mentions for his teaching style, with one student specifically regretting not taking him for MATH410 due to his "impeccable" lesson delivery and willingness to help students succeed.
*   **Tobias von Petersdorff** has received mixed reviews.
*   **Kendall Williams** is noted as a good lecturer but a "nightmare grader."
*   **David Hamilton** has been described as having an "unnecessarily difficult to follow" presentation.
*   **Casey Cremins** has generally received negative feedback.

To determine the best professor for achieving an 'A', it's recommended to investigate the grade distributions for these professors in MATH410. I will start by looking for grade information for Justin Wyss-Gallifent.

For MATH410 with Justin Wyss-Gallifent, based on a total of 243 students:

*   **A-range (A+/A/A-)**: 23.05%
*   **Pass Rate (>= C-)**: 81.48%

Here's a breakdown of the specific grade percentages:
*   A+: 1.65%
*   A: 13.17%
*   A-: 8.23%
*   B+: 4.53%
*   B: 21.81%
*   B-: 7.00%
*   C+: 2.06%
*   C: 19.34%
*   C-: 3.70%
*   D: 7.41%
*   D-: 0.82%
*   F: 2.06%
*   W (Withdrawal): 7.41%
*   Other: 0.82%

While Justin Wyss-Gallifent is well-regarded for his teaching, securing an 'A' in MATH410 with him appears to be challenging, with less than a quarter of students achieving an A-range grade. However, the overall pass rate is quite high.

Would you like me to check the grade distributions for other professors like Tobias von Petersdorff, Kendall Williams, David Hamilton, or Casey Cremins, or would you like to consider searching for any other professors for MATH410?

Compare with all the professors who teach the course

## Assistant

That's a good idea. There are many professors who have taught MATH410. I will gather the grade reports for all unique professors who have taught the course and then compare their A-range percentages. This might take a few steps as I need to query each professor individually.

Let's start by getting the grade reports for some of the more commonly mentioned professors, and then I can expand if needed to get a comprehensive comparison.

Here are the grade reports for some of the professors that appeared in the initial course information:

| Sandra Cerrai           | 127            | **18.11%**                     |
| Christian Rosendal      | 55             | **16.36%**                     |
| Kendall Williams        | 100            | **7.00%**                      |

**Observations:**

*   **Tristan Buckmaster** currently shows the highest A-range percentage at **70.00%**, though this is based on a smaller class size (10 students).
*   **Stefan Doboszczak** also has a very high A-range percentage of **41.25%** with a larger student sample (257 students), making him a strong candidate.
*   Other professors with A-range percentages above 35% include **Richard Wentworth**, **Anna Szczekutowicz**, **Manoussos Grillakis**, **Lei Chen**, and **Casey Cremins**.

It's important to consider both the percentage and the total number of students when evaluating these figures. While a high percentage with a small class size might indicate an easier path to an A, it could also be subject to more variability. Larger class sizes offer a more stable reflection of grade distributions.

Do you have any further questions about these professors or would you like me to look into any specific ones in more detail?

ok great. is williams good for MATH241?

## Assistant

Kendall Williams has a mixed reputation for MATH241, with an average rating of 3.35 on PlanetTerp. Here's a summary of what students say about him for MATH241:

**Positives:**
*   **Clear and Organized Lectures:** Many students praise his lecturing style, noting his clear explanations, good handwriting, and methodical approach to problems. He often goes through numerous examples in class.
*   **Personable and Approachable:** He is generally described as a nice guy, open to questions in class and during office hours, and willing to help students.
*   **Good Resources for Practice:** He provides suggested problems from the textbook, and some students found that doing these extensively helped prepare for exams.
*   **Focus on Application:** Some students appreciate his focus on the application of concepts rather than overly theoretical explanations.
*   **No Minus Grades:** A few reviews mention that he doesn't give minus grades (e.g., an 82% would be a B, not a B-), which can be a grade booster.

**Negatives:**
*   **Extremely Difficult Exams:** This is the most consistent and prominent complaint. His exams are frequently described as "incredibly difficult," "a real time crunch," and "much harder than other professors'." Students report that questions are often conceptual word problems that require immediate recognition and quick problem-solving, with little time for thinking.
*   **Lack of Direct Preparation for Exams:** While he provides practice problems, many students feel that the exams contain questions that are significantly harder or different in style from what is covered in lectures or homework, with "random curveballs."
*   **Strict Grading and No Curve:** Several reviews highlight his strict grading on exams and a general lack of curving, even when class averages are low (e.g., in the 40s or 50s).
*   **Time-Consuming Assignments:** Homework and MATLAB assignments can be very challenging and take a lot of time.
*   **Poor Communication:** Some students report issues with his responsiveness to emails and less-than-helpful office hours for individual conceptual help, sometimes being told to ask other students.
*   **Lack of Sympathy for Tech Issues:** During online semesters, students reported no leniency for technological issues during exam submissions.

**Overall for MATH241:**
While Kendall Williams is generally seen as a good lecturer who explains concepts well, his MATH241 courses are notorious for extremely challenging and time-pressured exams. Success with him seems to depend heavily on a strong work ethic, significant self-study beyond lectures (especially with textbook problems), and a willingness to tackle difficult application-based problems. If you are aiming for an 'A' and are prepared for a very rigorous experience, he might be an option, but be aware of the high difficulty of his assessments. Many students suggest taking another professor if available, especially if you prefer a less intense exam experience or rely more on direct exam preparation from lectures.

Reddit discussions about Kendall Williams for MATH241 largely echo the sentiments found in the PlanetTerp reviews, particularly emphasizing the difficulty of his exams.

Here are the key takeaways from Reddit regarding Kendall Williams for MATH241:

*   **Challenging Exams are a Consistent Theme:** Several posts directly ask for advice on "How to do well on Professor Kendell Williams MATH241 exams?" Students express feeling "lost" and note that his exams are "nothing like the suggested problems that he says to do from the textbook." They struggle with "deconstructing his questions" and even students from other MATH241 sections find his practice tests hard to approach.
*   **Comparison to Other Professors:** Students frequently ask for comparisons between Williams and other MATH241 professors (e.g., Wiseley Wong, Terence Long), often seeking information on who is "easier."
*   **Concerns about Difficulty for Freshmen/Those with AP Credit:** A freshman who scored 5s on both AP Calc AB and BC expressed confusion about whether Williams' class is "doable" given the "harsh reviews and warnings on planet terp," considering dropping down to an easier Calc 2. This highlights the perceived jump in difficulty even for well-prepared students.
*   **Workload and Study Habits:** While not explicitly detailed in every post, the recurring theme of difficult exams suggests a significant workload and the need for strong study habits to succeed.

In summary, Reddit reinforces the idea that Kendall Williams' MATH241 class is rigorous, with exams that are particularly challenging and may not align directly with practice materials. Students often find themselves seeking extra strategies to tackle his unique exam style. If you thrive on a significant challenge and are prepared to adapt your study methods to his demanding assessments, you might consider him. However, if your priority is an easier path to an A, the Reddit consensus suggests exploring other professors.
